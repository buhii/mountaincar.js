# mountaincar.js

A simple test bed for reinforcement learning. [Online Demo](http://buhii.github.io/mountaincar.js/index.html)

Using [p5.js](http://p5js.org/), Sarsa/Q-learning and CMAC (tile coding) ported from
[Jeremy Stober's python implementation](https://github.com/stober/cmac).

I also tried [ConvNetJS](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs) and
[DQN implementation](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo.html) but I couldn't find appropriate settings yet.
